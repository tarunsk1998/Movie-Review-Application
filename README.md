# Movie Review Application

### Overview
This repository contains the files for the Movie Review Application Project.

In this project, I've used what I've learned about deep neural networks and Natural Language Processing for Movie review Sentiment Analysis. I've trained, validated and tested Stacked LSTM model using Keras.

### The project structure:

model (directory contains the trained model and Jupyter Notebook code for the model creation)
static (directory has static components such as CSS for the HTML page of this application)
tenplates (contains the HTML pages of the application)
movie_review_app.py (the base Flask file that hosts the application)

## The Project
### The goals / steps of this project are the following:

Design, train and validate a model that predicts if a movie review written is "Positive" or "Negative"
save the trained model and use it for the Sentiment analysis of the review
A Web Application should accept movie review text input from user and display if the review written is positive or negative
