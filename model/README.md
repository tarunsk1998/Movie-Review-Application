The Jupyter Notebook (MovieReviewNLP.ipynb) was executed in Google Colab.

Contents of the Notebook.
- Text Preprocessing of the Movie reviews using nltk library
- Extractive summarization of the reviews as the reviews are too long
- Stacked LSTM Deep Learning model creation
- Model training, testing and saving
- Finally the Hyperparameter session

The Stacked LSTM model used in MovieReviewNLP.ipynb provided better accuracy compared to LSTM and Bi-directional LSTM networks. But the BERT model implemented in MovieReviewNLP_BERT.ipynb was the best model for the Sentimental Analysis.
